# Intoduction to inference

These are an in progress set of notes on Bayesian inference intended to explain various topics to newcomers to the field.

There is a slant towards inference in the context of gravitational-wave astronomy, however, I hope it is useful to a wider audience.

This is by no means a comprehensive set of materials, if you notice any errors/glaring omissions please open an issue, or otherwise let me know!
